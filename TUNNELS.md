# Tunnel providers and motion preferences

## Desktop settings

Open **Settings**. The groups are Appearance, Public connection, Server, and Security & sandbox.
- **Interface animations** controls transitions, button feedback and decorative traffic particles.
- **Background animations** independently controls the slow aurora. Disabling it removes its CSS animation; it does not keep an invisible animation running.
- Appearance is saved automatically on this device. The existing `mcp-terminal-animation` preference is retained; its disabled value disables both categories when migrating. The new background preference is `mcp-terminal-background-animation`.
- System **Reduced Motion** overrides decorative movement, including when changed while the app is open. Monitoring and functional loading indicators remain available.
- The dialog uses Radix/shadcn primitives: focus stays in the dialog, Escape closes it, and selects/switches support the keyboard. Light/dark settings follow the system scheme.

## Choose a connection

| Provider | Requirement | Important limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No tunnel | None | Local MCP URL; no public tunnel process. |
| ngrok | Built-in SDK, ngrok account/token | Domain availability, traffic and fixed domains depend on the provider plan. |
| Tuna | Install Tuna CLI; `tuna login` or API key with `tunnels:connect` | Assigned free permanent subdomain is account-bound. Arbitrary names/custom domains may require a subscription. |
| Cloudflare — named | Install cloudflared; connector token and an already routed HTTPS hostname | Route the hostname in Cloudflare to this local host/port. Do not put an interactive Access login in front of MCP unless supported by the client. |
| Cloudflare — quick | Install cloudflared | Temporary hostname, **no SSE**. Marked **Unverified**; `/sse` and streaming MCP can fail. Not recommended for MCP. |
| LocalTunnel | Explicitly install `npm install -g localtunnel` | Experimental. A password/interstitial page can block MCP clients. Requested subdomains are not guaranteed. Always marked **Unverified**. |

Save, then explicitly **Restart** (or Start if stopped). Saving never restarts a running server. The active connection and Bearer key stay unchanged until restart. Provider-specific settings are retained when switching. Only one tunnel runs at a time.

The endpoint card and tray show the active provider/state and let you copy the MCP URL. **Connected** means an address was assigned or a named Cloudflare connector connected, not that an external MCP session was verified. **Unverified** additionally means known provider restrictions. Disconnection or failure clears the public URL.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`. Set `TUNNEL_PROVIDER=none|ngrok|tuna|cloudflare|localtunnel`. If absent/empty, old `NGROK_ENABLED` behavior and `NGROK_*` values (including `NGROK_TOKEN`) are retained. An explicit provider takes priority.

- ngrok: `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`, `NGROK_DOMAIN`.
- Tuna: `TUNA_API_KEY`, `TUNA_SUBDOMAIN`, optional `TUNA_EXECUTABLE`.
- Cloudflare: optional `CLOUDFLARED_EXECUTABLE`; `CLOUDFLARE_MODE=quick|named`. Named mode also needs `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp.example.com` (origin only, no `/mcp`).
- LocalTunnel: optional `LOCALTUNNEL_EXECUTABLE`, `LOCALTUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN`.

Executable settings are paths, never shell command lines. On Windows, the installed global npm `lt.cmd` resolves to its fixed LocalTunnel JS entry, run without a shell. Restart the desktop app after changing PATH. No automatic CLI downloads, `npx` installs, logins, DNS changes or provider-account tunnel creation.

## Security

MCP still uses **Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>** (or the existing x-api-key mechanism). Provider credentials are separate. Keep sandbox restrictions and explicit allowed hosts. Only the exact active tunnel hostname is temporarily allowed, then removed on disconnect/stop. Never use `ALLOWED_HOSTS=*`.

Keys entered in Settings are stored in the local configuration file, not an OS credential vault. Protect that file with your Windows account permissions. Keys are masked in the UI; tunnel subprocess arguments/logs intentionally omit them. CLI subprocesses are not given the MCP key or other providers’ credentials. Tuna’s inspector is disabled.

The CLI process tree is stopped on server stop/restart/exit. Startup times out after 40 seconds and terminates that process rather than leaving an invisible tunnel running.

Building does not certify external tunnels. Verify with your own MCP client and installed CLI/account. Browser-gated services can be unsuitable even when a public URL is printed.
